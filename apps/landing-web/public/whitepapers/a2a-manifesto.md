# A2A ORCHESTRATION ARCHITECTURE: THE "TITANIUM" PROTOCOL
**Date:** February 2026
**Author:** ACTIVA SL Engineering Team
**Abstract:** This paper outlines the shift from SaaS (Software as a Service) to A2A (Agent-to-Agent) ecosystems in enterprise management.

## 1. Introduction: The Fall of Human Interface
Legacy software relies on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations performed by humans. This is inefficient. The Titanium Protocol delegates CRUD to **Active Agents** (e.g., Google Gemini) acting upon **Passive Knowledge Bases** (e.g., NotebookLM).

## 2. Evidence-Based AI (EBAI)
To solve the Hallucination Problem (HP), Activa SL implements a **Strict Evidence Enforcement Layer (SEEL)**.
*   **Rule 1:** No output is generated without a file reference (PDF/JSON).
*   **Rule 2:** Visual signals ("Traffic Lights") are deterministic, not probabilistic.

## 3. The CEO as Orchestrator
The human role shifts to high-level decision making based on pre-digested Agent consensus.
*   *Input:* Agent Report (Status: RED).
*   *Action:* Human Authorization (Voice Command).
*   *Output:* Agent Execution (API Call).

## 4. Technical Implementation
Built on React 19, Firebase, and Vertex AI. 
This architecture ensures <100ms latency for critical decision loops.
